# THE CTU-13 DATASET. A LABELED DATASET WITH BOTNET, NORMAL AND BACKGROUND TRAFFIC.
# The CTU-13 is a dataset of botnet traffic that was captured in the CTU University, Czech Republic, in 2011. The goal of the dataset was to have a large capture of real botnet traffic mixed with normal traffic and background traffic. The CTU-13 dataset consists in thirteen captures (called scenarios) of different botnet samples. On each scenario we executed a specific malware, which used several protocols and performed different actions.
